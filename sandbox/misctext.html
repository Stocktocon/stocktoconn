                In guilty gear we use numberpad notation to notate inputs and moves. 
                <dfn id="numpad-notation">Numberpad notation</dfn> uses numbers 123456789 to represent the cardinal and diagonal directions.
                The number represents one of the 8 cardinal or diagonals based on their placement on the numberpad. There's one exception.
                5 represents a neutral movement input, meaning no movement keys pressed. but for example, 8 is up, 9 is up forward, 6 is up, 2 is down, 1 is down back, 4 is back.
                A basic quarter circle forward input could be notated as <code>236</code>, meaning down, down+forward, forward. <br>
